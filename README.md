# Wifi Indoor Localization Techniques

A Collection of python scripts used for Indoor Localization.

Check out net.py for a convenient script to search for wifi networks and connect using only the command line. (given that the network you want to connect is within range and set up in your wpa_supplicant.conf file.)

The other scripts are mainly used for collecting wifi data, plotting a heatmap, using gathered data (eg. positions.csv) to find position in space using Multilateration and Fingerprinting techniques etc. 

Repo is totally unstructured, open to everyone seeking some ideas burined in the code :) .For anything else, contact me at konapostolo95@gmail.com
